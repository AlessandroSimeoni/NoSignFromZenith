      COLLECTIBLE 3 - WILL Diary



      I knew this would happen;
      violence only leads to this. The only way to end this massacre is to return
      to where it all began and hope that F.R.E.E. puts us all into hibernation.



      I
      would have wished for a different end, but freedom of choice also involves
      choices.
