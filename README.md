Signs of communication from the Zenith spaceship suddenly ceased after an asteroid hit it.  
AL3X, a scout robot, is sent on Zenith to discover what happened.  
The astronauts were sent to bomb the sun with nuclear weapons to save humanity from the next glacial era, but the spacecraftâ€™s AI F.R.E.E. and the robots around the base mysteriously shut down.

Overcome puzzles and logic challenges to explore the starship looking for answers.  

No Sign From Zenith is a first person puzzle game developed in Unity. It is the first 3D project made at the game academy.
It was developed in a month in a team of 13 people (6 designers, 2 programmers, 3 concept artists and 2 3D artists).
During the development of this project I started to improve my technical skills in the game development and began to learn how to communicate between departments.
